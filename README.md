To access our web app, the user must hit the following URL on either their phone or computer:  (vcm-1853.vm.duke.edu). 
On this page, the user must fill out a form with personal information including their name, date of birth and gender. 
This is necessary because these identifiers are passed into a database that physicians can use to access past results. 
The user must then upload an image of the area of interest on the skin. Our program is capable of taking in pictures in 
the following formats: .jpg, .png., .bmp. For the most accurate results, the user should try to take a picture in good 
lighting and clear skin from the region as best as possible. To submit the form and uploaded picture, click the button 
labeled “SUBMIT AND VIEW RESULTS” and an alert confirming the submission will appear. 

The web page will then reload and display a table that contains the patient’s name, date of birth and the probability 
that the lesion is malignant/non-malignant. Below the Melanoma Predictions, the Melanoma Border section will be used to 
give the physician more info about the regularity of the lesion border. Border irregularity is one of the key features 
physicians use to determine whether a particular melanoma is malignant. The Melanoma Color section at the bottom of the 
page will display a histogram of the pixel intensities found in the uploaded image. This is important because a bimodal 
distribution can suggest the presence of dark pigment compared to the surrounding skin. To return to the home page, 
click “Melanoma Results”, followed by “Return to Home Page.”
